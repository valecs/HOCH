* You might get started with a:
  
  % y | make remove ; make clean; make

* In case you're on an ancient machine with old versions of gcc, you
  can direct mpicc to use a newer one with:

  % make OMPI_CC=gcc-6.2 FC=gfortran-6.2

  As shown above, a binary-compatible fortran comilier will need to be
  specified too. For what it's worth, this is a BAD IDEA (TM).
